>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 127 - the crosshair is semi-transparent. "
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 255 - the crosshair is nontransparent. "
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 250 - the crosshair is slightly transparent (Mine).
> * Recoil to slow? Go to Extras Tab Click Mouse Properties &
>   * Set windows mouse sensitivity to middle (50%)
>   * Disable Enhance pointer precision
> * If you cant apply the key you want then EDIT Setting.ini to the proper key.
