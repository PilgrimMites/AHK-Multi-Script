> * ``If MENU has Errors, Delete Settings.ini.``
> * If Pixelbot is not shooting its because your ingame crosshair. You must lower the opacity or open the center. 
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 0 - the crosshair is completely transparent (invisible) "
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 127 - the crosshair is semi-transparent. "
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 255 - the crosshair is nontransparent. "
>   * " cl_crosshairalpha 250 - the crosshair is slightly transparent (Mine).
> * Recoil to slow? Go to Extras Tab Click Mouse Properties &
>   * Set windows mouse sensitivity to middle (50%)
>   * Disable Enhance pointer precision
> * If you cant apply the key you want then EDIT Setting.ini to the proper key.
> * Recoil Safety requires the designated key to be pressed then left click, in that order to engage the selected recoil.
> * If a gun is or isn't pulling down enough, adjust that guns humanizer by .05
